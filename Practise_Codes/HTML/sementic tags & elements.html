        <p><b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field[1] that uses statistics, scientific computing,
            scientific
            methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy,
            structured, and unstructured data.[2]</p>

        <p>Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences,
            information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a
            research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]</p>

            <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field[10] focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data
                sets and
                applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application
                domains. The
                field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data,
                developing
                data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of
                application
                domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science,
                mathematics,
                data visualization, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design,
                complex
                systems, communication and

                Statistician <b>Nathan Yau</b>, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer
                interaction: users
                should be able to intuitively control and explore data.[13][14] In
                2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine
                learning, and
                distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.[15]

            <h2><u>Relationship to statistics</u></h2>

            <p>Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather
                another
                name for statistics.[16] Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses
                on
                problems and techniques unique to digital data.[17] Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes
                quantitative
                data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from
                images,
                text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.[18]
                Andrew Gelman
                of Columbia University has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.[19]</p>

            <p>Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size
                of
                datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and
                statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied
                field
                growing out of traditional statistics.[20]</p>
